Driver view - authenticated
1. Left Panel

    Purpose: Displays a list of incoming ride requests (accepts) from users. Allows the host (driver) to view and accept these requests.
    Key Elements:
        Title: "Incoming Accepts"
        List of Incoming Accepts: Each item shows the name of the requester, how long ago the request was made, and an "Accept" button.
        Actions:
            Clicking the "Accept" button triggers the handleAccept function, which updates the main content to show details about the ride.
            If the right panel (Settings) is expanded, accepting a ride will automatically collapse the right panel, prioritizing the ride dashboard in the main content. This ensures the driver's focus is on the ride details.
        Buttons:
            Settings Button: Toggles the visibility of the right panel (Settings). If expanded, the right panel takes up 50% of the layout space, overlapping with the main content area. This button is disabled if the ride dashboard in the main component is active, to prevent distractions while managing a ride.

2. Main Content

    Purpose: Central area of the interface (middle of the component) showing dynamic content that is helpful for the driver (user) in finding and picking up their guest to drive to a destination.
    Key Elements:
        Ride Dashboard:
            Displays pickup and dropoff locations.
            Includes embedded Google Map routes for navigation.
            Contains a chat interface for communication between the host and guest.
        Dashboard Overview:
            Acts as the main render of the main component.
            Automatically shifts below the ride dashboard when the ride dashboard is active.
            Uses a grid layout to summarize Stripe-connected host stats, including total earnings, active rides, recent transactions, and upcoming bookings.
    Actions:
        Send Message: Allows the host to send a chat message to the guest.
        Pickup and Dropoff Buttons: Enables the driver to indicate when they have picked up or dropped off a guest, updating the ride status.
        Review Button: Allows the host to review the ride or guest after the ride is completed.
        Cancel Action: Closes the ride dashboard and resets the view, returning the main content to its default state (Dashboard Overview).

3. Right Panel (Settings Panel)

    Purpose: Provides settings options and configurations for the user/host, including troubleshooting Stripe account issues or making adjustments to app settings.
    Key Elements:
        Title: "Settings"
        Content:
            Placeholder text indicating where settings options will be displayed.
            Additional sections for resolving Stripe account errors and other configuration settings.
    Actions:
        Toggle Visibility: Clicking the toggle button opens or closes the panel.
            When visible, the panel occupies 50% of the layout space, pushing or overlapping the main content.
            The panel is either fully visible (taking up 50% of space) or completely hidden (0% of space).
        The right panel should automatically collapse if a ride is accepted to ensure maximum focus on the ride management in the main content.

Additional Suggestions:

    Responsive Design Considerations: Ensure that the layout dynamically adjusts based on screen size, particularly for mobile users. Panels could slide in or out as overlays instead of occupying fixed 50% widths on smaller screens.
    User Feedback and Accessibility: Incorporate visual feedback (e.g., button highlights, panel transition animations) and ensure all interactive elements are accessible via keyboard navigation for better user experience.
    Error Handling: Include error messages or indicators for failed actions, such as a failed ride acceptance or a Stripe account issue, to provide users with immediate feedback.

By adding these refinements, you'll have a more detailed and user-friendly layout that considers usability and functionality.
